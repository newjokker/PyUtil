Help on Document in module docx.document object:

class Document(docx.shared.ElementProxy)
 |  WordprocessingML (WML) document. Not intended to be constructed directly.
 |  Use :func:`docx.Document` to open or create a document.
 |
 |  Method resolution order:
 |      Document
 |      docx.shared.ElementProxy
 |      builtins.object
 |
 |  Methods defined here:
 |

 |  __init__(self, element, part)
 |      Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
 |
 |  add_heading(self, text='', level=1)
 |      Return a heading paragraph newly added to the end of the document,
 |      containing *text* and having its paragraph style determined by
 |      *level*. If *level* is 0, the style is set to `Title`. If *level* is
 |      1 (or omitted), `Heading 1` is used. Otherwise the style is set to
 |      `Heading {level}`. Raises |ValueError| if *level* is outside the
 |      range 0-9.
 |
 |  add_page_break(self)
 |      Return a paragraph newly added to the end of the document and
 |      containing only a page break.
 |
 |  add_paragraph(self, text='', style=None)
 |      Return a paragraph newly added to the end of the document, populated
 |      with *text* and having paragraph style *style*. *text* can contain
 |      tab (``\t``) characters, which are converted to the appropriate XML
 |      form for a tab. *text* can also include newline (``\n``) or carriage
 |      return (``\r``) characters, each of which is converted to a line
 |      break.
 |
 |  add_picture(self, image_path_or_stream, width=None, height=None)
 |      Return a new picture shape added in its own paragraph at the end of
 |      the document. The picture contains the image at
 |      *image_path_or_stream*, scaled based on *width* and *height*. If
 |      neither width nor height is specified, the picture appears at its
 |      native size. If only one is specified, it is used to compute
 |      a scaling factor that is then applied to the unspecified dimension,
 |      preserving the aspect ratio of the image. The native size of the
 |      picture is calculated using the dots-per-inch (dpi) value specified
 |      in the image file, defaulting to 72 dpi if no value is specified, as
 |      is often the case.
 |
 |  add_section(self, start_type=2)
 |      Return a |Section| object representing a new section added at the end
 |      of the document. The optional *start_type* argument must be a member
 |      of the :ref:`WdSectionStart` enumeration, and defaults to
 |      ``WD_SECTION.NEW_PAGE`` if not provided.
 |
 |  add_table(self, rows, cols, style=None)
 |      Add a table having row and column counts of *rows* and *cols*
 |      respectively and table style of *style*. *style* may be a paragraph
 |      style object or a paragraph style name. If *style* is |None|, the
 |      table inherits the default table style of the document.
 |
 |  save(self, path_or_stream)
 |      Save this document to *path_or_stream*, which can be either a path to
 |      a filesystem location (a string) or a file-like object.

 |  Data descriptors defined here:
 |
 |  core_properties
 |      A |CoreProperties| object providing read/write access to the core
 |      properties of this document.
 |
 |  inline_shapes
 |      An |InlineShapes| object providing access to the inline shapes in
 |      this document. An inline shape is a graphical object, such as
 |      a picture, contained in a run of text and behaving like a character
 |      glyph, being flowed like other text in a paragraph.
 |
 |  paragraphs
 |      A list of |Paragraph| instances corresponding to the paragraphs in
 |      the document, in document order. Note that paragraphs within revision
 |      marks such as ``<w:ins>`` or ``<w:del>`` do not appear in this list.
 |
 |  part
 |      The |DocumentPart| object of this document.
 |
 |  sections
 |      A |Sections| object providing access to each section in this
 |      document.
 |
 |  settings
 |      A |Settings| object providing access to the document-level settings
 |      for this document.
 |
 |  styles
 |      A |Styles| object providing access to the styles in this document.
 |
 |  tables
 |      A list of |Table| instances corresponding to the tables in the
 |      document, in document order. Note that only tables appearing at the
 |      top level of the document appear in this list; a table nested inside
 |      a table cell does not appear. A table within revision marks such as
 |      ``<w:ins>`` or ``<w:del>`` will also not appear in the list.

 |  Methods inherited from docx.shared.ElementProxy:
 |
 |  __eq__(self, other)
 |      Return |True| if this proxy object refers to the same oxml element as
 |      does *other*. ElementProxy objects are value objects and should
 |      maintain no mutable local state. Equality for proxy objects is
 |      defined as referring to the same XML element, whether or not they are
 |      the same proxy object instance.
 |
 |  __ne__(self, other)
 |      Return self!=value.
